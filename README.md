# 🌍 Africa Network Infrastructure Optimizer

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Shedrackeze002/africa-network-optimizer)

**A comprehensive data-driven solution for optimizing African network infrastructure and enhancing continental connectivity.**

## 🚀 Quick Start with GitHub Codespaces

**The fastest way to run the full interactive application:**

1. **Click the Codespaces badge above** or go to your repository
2. **Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"**
3. **Wait for the environment to load** (2-3 minutes)
4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   cd routing_optimizer
   python run_app.py
   ```
5. **Access the application** via the forwarded port (usually port 5000)

The Codespace automatically installs all dependencies and sets up the development environment!
